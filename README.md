# Tic Tac Toe

### A very very simple tic tac toe game built for understanding how minimax works.

 I used react to save time programming, also my implementation of minimax is quite slow because i couldn't get alpha-beta pruning to work right, it had some weird bugs.

#### It could be optimised better, but it is a side project so no time for now.

It's built with create-react-app so it's pretty easy to start

    npm run start
or if you are using yarn

    yarn start
